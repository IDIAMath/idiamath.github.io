# Tutorials from IDIAM

This repo builds automatically as github pages at [https://idiamath.github.io](https://idiamath.github.io).
The intention is to provide tutorials on using STACK for visual questions.
We use the issue tracker to record desired examples of such questions and
needs for new and revised pages.  Ideas and sketches are kept in the web
pages, whose code is under docs.
