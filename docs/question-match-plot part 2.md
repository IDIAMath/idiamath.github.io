# Read Some Properties From A Graph

I split the following question into two problems for now
due to a problem with creating 3 PRT's,
although i could create 2 PRT's as you can tell in part 2.

## Question Interpretation

> Given a a surface defined by $$z=f(x,y)$$, where exact expression for $$f$$ is unknown to a user, ask the user to select a point on it where partial derivatives are positive/negative/zero. Given the same, ask the user to select local maxima/minima.
I interpret this as: find a point on the functions where one of the three derivatives gives a positive number, another gives a negative and the third gives 0. For example, you could have a point that gives Fxy=1, Fx = 0, Fy=-1, that would be a solution.

It can also be interpreted as: select a point on the function where ALL partial derivatives would give a negative positive or 0. If so, this would be very similar to the provided solution and it would be an easy task change the solution to accommodate the following interpretation.


## Part 2
