# Tutorials (Question Examples)

The following tutorials are written to illustrate concrete questions
that could be given to students in higher education.
We aim to discuss the STACK and JSXGraph features used as well as the
motivation for the question, but there is room for improvement, so 
please give feedback.

Each tutorial will provide the Moodle XML code for the question,
so that you can easily import it in your own server and test it,
as well as the discussing of the design.

The questions are not really indended to be ready for use.  
We reckon that most teachers will want to tailor the questions to
their students and use the questions primarily as examples to build
on.

## Visualising functions in two variables

+ Question [match-properties](question/match-properties.md).
  Give an arbitrary function with given properties, with visual aid.
+ Question [Tune 3D Function](question/tune-3d-function.md)
    Tune parameters of a function to match another function visually
+ Question [Tune 3D polynomoial](question/tune-3d.md)
    Minimal working example of question using jsxgraph
